  The traditional algo trading strategies have been proven to be old because of how simple and its massive use in the market. For the purpose of beating the market, we will be using the Donchian Channel Indicator to help enter and exit the market at the right time.

This indicator will enter the market if the stock's current high exceeds the 50-week high and exit the market if the stock curret low sinks below the 40-week low. This strategy is a weekly trading system while we will be backtesting it on the weekly timeframe.

The packages used includes pandas, yfinance, matplotlib, termcolor and math.
